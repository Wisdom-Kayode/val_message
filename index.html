        <h1>Happy Valentine’s Day, My Ruv😄! ❤️🌹</h1>
        <p>Since the very moment you walked into my life, everything changed in a way I never saw coming. I wasn’t looking for love, but somehow, you scammed me into believing in it again. 😏😂With you, I’ve learned to open up, to care deeply, and to cherish moments that I never want to forget.</p>
       <p> </p>
        <p>And then there’s our legendary inside joke—the night before we started dating when you traveled, and I texted you in distress, crying about how I had just met a girl and was already “deeply in love” with her. 🤦🏽‍♂️😂 My whole soul was in confusion, and you, being the kind-hearted therapist you are, gave me advice on how to get her… not knowing YOU were actually the love of my life. The way you never let me forget this will forever haunt me, but honestly, I wouldn’t have it any other way😂💀. </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>You are my peace and my storm, my challenge and my comfort, my best headache and my favorite blessing. 🥰 I know I don’t always express myself the way you want, but trust me, my heart beats for you in ways words can’t always capture. 💘</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>If love had a definition, it would be the way you hold me down, the way you push me to be better, and the way you somehow understand my silence when I can’t find the right words. And even though we don’t always get everything right, I’d rather figure it out with you than with anyone else. ❤️

</p>
       
        <p> </p>
        <p>Forever yours,<br><b>Wisdom ❤️❤</b></p>
